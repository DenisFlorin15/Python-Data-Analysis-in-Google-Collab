# Python Data Analysis Projects - Google Colab

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects developed during my learning journey in the **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"**. These projects focus on processing, cleaning, and visualizing real-world datasets using Python.

## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this repository is to showcase my ability to use Python for data science. Each notebook addresses a different dataset and uses various libraries to extract meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Environment:** Google Colab
- **Key Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `NumPy`: For numerical computing and N-dimensional arrays.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: For data visualization and linear regression plots.

## 📁 Projects Included

1. **Nobel Prize Analysis** – A deep dive into the history, demographics, and patterns of Nobel Prize winners over the years.
2. **Google Play Store App Analytics** – Cleaning and analyzing thousands of apps to identify trends in ratings, categories, and pricing.
3. **Lego Dataset Analysis** – Exploring the evolution of Lego sets, themes, and parts throughout the decades.
4. **Data Exploration with Pandas (College Majors)** – Analyzing salary data and career outcomes based on different college majors.
5. **Google Trends & Data Visualization** – Using search interest data to visualize trends and compare different topics over time.
6. **Computation with NumPy** – Implementing efficient mathematical operations using N-dimensional arrays.
7. **Seaborn & Linear Regression** – Utilizing advanced visualization techniques to find correlations and trends in data.
8. **Programming Languages Trends** – An analysis of the popularity and evolution of various programming languages.

## 📖 How to Use
1. Open any `.ipynb` file in this repository.
2. Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge (if available) or download the file.
3. Upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
